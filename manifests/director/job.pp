# This define handles the director portion of a job.  This define should not be
# used directly.  It is intended to be used only from the `bacula::job` define.
#
# This makes it simpler for the director to realize and override the conf_dir
# setting, so that the client conf_dir and the director conf_dir can differ,
# which is useful in a multi platform environment.
#
# @param content The full content of the job definition
# @param conf_dir Overridden at realize, should not need adjusting
#
# @example from bacula::job
#   @@bacula::director::job { $name:
#     content => template($template),
#     tag     => $real_tags,
#   }
#

  $content,
