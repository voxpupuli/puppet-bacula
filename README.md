# Bacula

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xaque208/puppet-bacula.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xaque208/puppet-bacula.svg?branch=master)

A puppet module for the Bacula backup system.

## Supported Platforms

* OpenBSD
* FreeBSD
* Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat, Centos, Fedora, SLES)

# Requirements

This module requires that [exported resources] have been setup (e.g. with [PuppetDB])

## Usage

To understand Bacula, the [Component Overview] in the Bacula documentation is a
useful start to begin understanding the moving parts.

### A Minimal Setup

What follows here is the bare minimum you would need to get a fully functional
Bacula environment with Puppet.  This setup assumes that the three components
of Bacula (Director, Storage, and Client) all run on three separate nodes.  If
desired, there is no reason this setup can not be build up on a single node,
just updating the hostnames used below to all point to the same system.

#### Defaults

Bacula's functionality depends on connecting several components.  Due to the 
numebr of moving pieces in this module, the you will likely want to set some 
site defaults, and tune more specifically where desired.

As such, it is reasonable to set the following hiera data that will allow 
many of the classes in this module to use those defaults sanely.

```
bacula::params::storage: 'mydirector.example.com'
bacula::params::director: 'mydirector.example.com'
```

This may be on the same host, or different hosts.  The Director will require
the classification of `bacula::director`, and the Storage node will require 
the classification of `bacula::storage`.

##### ** A NOTE FOR UPGRADERS **

Several params have been removed and replaced with the default names.  Update
your hiera data and parameters.

The following have been replaced with simply `bacula::params::director`.

* `bacula::params::director_name`
* `bacula::params::bacula_director`
 
The following have been replaced with simply `bacula::params::storage`.

* `bacula::params::bacula_storage`
* `bacula::params::storage_name`

#### SSL

To enable SSL for the communication between the various components of Bacula,
the hiera data for SSL must be set.

```yaml
bacula::params::ssl: true
```

This will ensure that SSL values are processed in the various templates that
are capable of SSL communication.  An item of note: this module expects to be
using the SSL directory for Puppet.  The default value for the Puppet SSL
directory this module will use is `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl` to support the
future unified Puppet deployment.

To change the SSL directory, simply set `bacula::params::ssl_dir`.  For
example, to use another module for the data source of which SSL directory to
use for Puppet, something like the following is in order.

```yaml
bacula::params::ssl_dir: "%{scope('puppet::params::puppet_ssldir')}"
```

This example assumes that you are using the [ploperations/puppet] module, but
this has been removed as a requirement as a dependency.  Users may also wish to
look at [theforeman/puppet].

#### Director Setup

The director component handles coordination of backups and databasing of
transactions.  In its simplest form, the director can be configured with a
simple declaration:

```Puppet
class { 'bacula::director': storage => 'mystorage.example.com' }
```

The `storage` parameter here defines which storage server should be used for 
all default jobs.  If left empty, it will default to the `::fqdn` of the 
director.
  
This is not a problem for all in one installations, but in scenarios where 
directors to not have the necessary storage devices attached, default jobs 
can be pointed elsewhere.

Note that if you expect an SD to be located on the Director, you will 
also need to include the `bacula::storage` class as follows.

By default a 'Common' fielset is created.

#### Storage Setup

The storage component allocates disk storage for pools that can be used for
holding backup data.

```Puppet
class { 'bacula::storage': director => 'mydirector.example.com' }
```

You will also want a storage pool that defines the retention.  You can define
 this in the Director catalog without exporting it, or you can use an 
 exported resource.

```Puppet
  @@bacula::director::pool { $::fqdn:
    volret      => '14 days',
    maxvolbytes => '5g',
    maxvols     => '200',
    label       => 'Main-',
    storage     => $::fqdn;
  }
```

#### Client Setup

The client component is run on each system that needs something backed up.

```Puppet
class { 'bacula::client': director => 'mydirector.example.com' }
```

To direct all jobs to a specific pool, 

```Puppet
bacula::client::default_pool: 'mystorage.example.com'
```

This assumes that you have a `bacula::director::pool` with the name 
`mystorage.example.com`.

## Creating Backup Jobs

In order for clients to be able to define jobs on the director, exported
resources are used, thus there was a reliance on PuppetDB availability in the
environment. In the client manifest the `bacula::job` can be declared as
follows:

```puppet
bacula::job { 'obsidian_logs':
  files => ['/var/log'],
}
```

Will create a new `Job` entry in `/etc/bacula/conf.d/job.conf` the next time
the director applies it's catalog that will instruct the system to backup the
files or directories at the paths specified in the `files` parameter.

If a group of jobs will contain the same files, a [FileSet resource] can be
used to simplify the `bacula::job` resource.  This can be exported from the
node (ensuring the resource title will be unique when realized) or a simple
resource specified on the director using the `bacula::fileset` defined type as
follows:

```puppet
bacula::fileset { 'Puppet':
  files   => ['/etc/puppet'],
  options => {'compression' => 'LZO' }
}
```

## Available types
